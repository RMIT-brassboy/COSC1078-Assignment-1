<h3>Some facts about me...</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I was born in Australia but I am half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese </li>
  <li>In 2019, I undertook a traineeship in Certificate III in Business 
    with Apprenticeship Support Australia where I have been working 
    as a Client Service Officer for almost 2.5 years.</li>
  <li>I'm capable of speaking Cantonese which has allowed me communicate easily 
    with a larger variety of clients.</li> 
  <li>I have a pet dog named Vilo. He is a Cavoodle (cross between Poodle and 
    Cavalier King Charles Spaniel) and is the cutest thing to enter my life 
    since COVID has happened! I have spoiled him rotten so now he stalks me 
    around the house seeking my love and attention. </li>
