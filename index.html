<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>
  In IT, I am most interested with software development and cybersecurity.
  The pursuit started in high-school when I attended an IT career seminar
  held at RMIT. A number of companies attended but the most noteworthy were
  WiseTech and Adobe. I became inspired by their success stories, the different
  apps they had created and their influence on the world, and so I decided that
  I wanted to be part of that revolutionary change that these companies and
  people were a part of.
</p>

<p>
  For cybersecurity, the main motivation admittedly originated from the
  prospects of high pay and the romanticism of being a computer hacker.
  However, after researching the industry and roles, I became drawn and
  motivated to the concept that I could be learning vital skills/knowledge to
  protect myself, my family and other people from cyber-attacks or scams.
  I also liked the idea of gathering information like a detective and having the
  legal immunity (when granted by the client) to attempt infiltration into a
  physical workplace or into their systems.
</p>

<p>
  The interest in software development grew from my own experience programming
  with Python and developing a number of small projects over the years since
  graduating from high-school. My projects ranged from a simple calculator to a
  budgeting app that keeps track of finances and provides information to help an
  end-user target particular issues with their budget.
  I enjoyed the problem solving, creative design, experimentation and learning
  aspects that came from this experience.
  </p>

<h3>Why did i choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
<p>
   I decided to go to RMIT because I believed it would be the place to provide
   me the best education and industry connections that I need to succeed.
   My choice was further cemented from a work colleague who recommended the
   course to me after graduating from the Bachelor of IT at RMIT.
</p>

<h3>What do I expect to learn during my studies?</h3>
<p>
  I expect I will draw valuable information and knowledge from my teachers and
  industry professionals. I want to learn from their experiences, the challenges
   they face, the career path they have taken so that I can continue my
   exploration into new pathways that I have yet to discover.
   It will also give me insights in the industry that I can infer whether or
   not I'll enjoy certain career paths. I'd like to learn industry standard
   skills that will boost my prospects to achieving a high paying career and
   even the possibility of starting my own business.
   Finally, I want to develop my snetworking skills so that I can create
   multiple connections in the industry for more career opportunities.

  <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
  <iframe src="placeholder.pdf#toolbar=0" width="50%" height="800px">
   </iframe>

  <h3>Position Description and why it's appealing</h3>
  <p>
    The Position's role and duties primarily revolves around ensuring the safety
    and security of the business' network and data. It seems to be a role where
    you would devote most of your skills and knowledge to monitoring, creating
    strategies or utilising tools to prevent security issues/attacks or formulate
    a quick response. When you're not doing performing those duties,
    you're also promoting, training and teaching others in the organisation
    about the threats and risks that are current and how to respond/prevent
    falling victim.

    I find the role appealing in general for 3 reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>The role description and mission strongly aligns with my goal to
        utilise my skills to protect myself or others from online threats.
        This role allows me to heavily focus on the Security Operations of a
        business and also have opportunities to teach others so that they can
        then protect themselves and those they know. </li>
      <li>SEEK is a company with a good reputation. Having visited their office in person, I was very impressed with their mission statement, their facilities and overall company culture. They provide lots of employee benefits and have great values that align with my moral compass. </li>
      <li>Most roles within cybersecurity have an average salary of $100k which is an amount I am ambitious to achieve and earn in my career. </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

<h3>Skills, qualfications and experience required</h3>
<p>
  Skills – Soft skills required would include communication, attention-to-detail, problem-solving and flexibility.
  <li>Communication skills in this role are required as you will be liaising with both internal and external stakeholders. You'll need to build a relationship within the business to effectively promote the security culture and with external stakeholders for excellent client service overall. </li>
  <li>Security monitoring will require great vigilance and attention-to-detail in order to catch any security threats and develop an appropriate response. </li>
  <li>Problem-solving and flexibility are intertwined because security threats are always changing so you'll need to constantly keep up to date to effectively develop the strategies and responses to combat them. It is also unlikely for one to deal with the same exact scenario so it's especially crucial to resolve cases quickly, otherwise the severity of it will increase exponentially.  </li>

  Qualifications - No formal degree/certification is required but it will prove useful to being a desirable candidate.

  Experience - Past experience in the cybersecurity field and crucial understanding of different networking tools and OS are all required. Extra experience with Python, PowerShell, DevOps on AWS platforms are desirable but not required to perform the role.
</p>

<h3>Skills, qualfications and experience I currently possess</h3>
<p>
  Skills - My role as a Client Service Officer has the same demands for soft skills so I believe I already have these skills to meet the requirements of a Security Analyst. It would be easily transferrable and applicable despite being in different fields.

  Qualifications - I currently don't have any formal qualifications to make me desirable as a Security Analyst, however working towards the Bachelor of IT and TCM Security's "Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT) Certifications can prove to make me a highly desirable candidate.

  Experience - I also have no formal experience that can be applied except for having stakeholder engagement and relationship building experience.
</p>

<h3>My plan to becoming qualified for this position</h3>
<p>
  I plan to achieve the qualifications and experience I need by first completing the Bachelor of IT and choosing units that help me specialise into this role. If an opportunity for an internship or career within cybersecurity is available, I will immediately apply for the opportunity. After completing the Bachelor of IT, I plan to complete additional certifications like the mentioned PNPT certification so I become a better candidate.
